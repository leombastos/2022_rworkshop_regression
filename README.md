# Regression for optimum rate and prediction R Workshop 

Hey there!  

This is a public GitHub repository to share the files needed for the **Kansas State University/University of Georgia 2022 AGSA R Workshop - Regression for optimum rate and prediction R Workshop**, taught by [@leombastos](https://github.com/leombastos).    

The workshop is presented in one day for 2 hours where we will cover:  
    - Linear, quadratic, and linear-plateau regression
    - Regression analysis workflow including  
      - data import
      - data wrangling
      - exploratory data analysis
      - formal statistical analysis
      - model assumption checking with residual diagnostics
      - model summary
      - final plot
    - Difference between ANOVA and regression
    - Model selection
    - Explore some cool applications of regression like 
        - finding an optimum input rate that maximizes yield
        - prediction
